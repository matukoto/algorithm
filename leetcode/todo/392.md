 Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

 A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 Example 1:
 Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
 Output: true
 Example 2:
 Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
 Output: false

 Constraints:

  0 <= s.length <= 100
  0 <= t.length <= 10⁴
  s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

 Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s₁, s₂, ..., sk where k >= 10⁹, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
